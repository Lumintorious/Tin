Expense/Travel/Mileage in the same screen?
Add receipt later - does it remove the attachments I added? Is it the same as pressing the X button?
Lots of screen space in Create new Expense, could maybe have attachment part without modal?
I like the editable rows on the go, always wanted this in Tripletex, probably just a figma thing though.
Tooltips with layman language for dum-dums like me. eg per diem compensation.
What if stay is long, is Per diem meal table too long then?
Are hotels/locations free text or searchable/indexed entries?
I like the reorderable approvers.
Maybe use arrows in Approval flow to make it clear (when choosing)? (is it bottom up, top-down?)
Headers for overview tables
How final are requests/approvals?
If there are company limits for budgets, maybe reinforce them in UI before submitting.
Can you add a message to a rejection or is this supposed to be a slack issue?
If expenses can be free but also on travels, how about a dot-dot-dot view in overview?

Petty:

-  Why separate Create New & Kebab from bar?
-  Norwegian, my only weakness!
